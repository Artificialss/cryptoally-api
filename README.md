Historical price and catalog data for **1,864 assets** — crypto, stablecoins, US
stocks/ETFs, commodities, and 27 international stock markets — served as a REST/JSON
API. Built in Rust, deployed on [Vercel's official Rust runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/rust).

The API and the data it serves are a **commercial, proprietary service** — not a free
service and not open data. Access requires an API key issued to a customer.

This repository is the **engineering reference** for the API: its real source
(architecture, routing, auth, database access), with the source code MIT-licensed. It does
not contain the database schema, the data-ingestion pipeline, or any proprietary data —
every example below is a real, live response, but this repo itself ships no data. For
plans, current docs, and to request an API key, see
**[www.cryptoally.dev](https://www.cryptoally.dev)**.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/prices?market=crypto&symbol=bitcoin&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-03"
```

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "open": "42280.23437500",
    "high": "44175.43750000",
    "low": "42214.97656250",
    "close": "44167.33203125",
    "volume": 18426978443
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-02",
    "open": "44187.14062500",
    "high": "45899.70703125",
    "low": "44176.94921875",
    "close": "44957.96875000",
    "volume": 39335274536
  }
]
```

Prices are always in the asset's native currency (see its `currency` field from
`/api/assets`) — there's no server-computed USD field; converting to USD or any other
currency is a client concern.

Don't have a key yet? See [Usage & access](#usage--access).

## Authentication

Every endpoint except `/api/health` requires an `x-api-key` header. A missing or
invalid key gets a `401` before any database query runs:

```bash
curl "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/assets"
```

```json
{ "error": "missing or invalid API key (x-api-key header)" }
```

```
HTTP/2 401
```

Keys are opaque, random tokens; only their SHA-256 hash is ever stored server-side —
the plaintext is shown once, at issuance, and never persisted. See
[Usage & access](#usage--access) to request one.

## Endpoints

All responses are JSON. Standard status codes throughout: `200` success, `400`
malformed request, `401` missing/invalid key, `404` no such asset/entry, `500`/`503`
server- or database-side failure.

### `GET /api/health`

Liveness + database connectivity check. The only public endpoint — no API key
required.

```bash
curl "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/health"
```

```json
{ "status": "ok", "database": "ok" }
```

### `GET /api/assets`

Screener-style asset list — filter, search, paginate, and localize the market name.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | `crypto` \| `stablecoin` \| `stock` \| `etf` \| `index` \| `commodity` |
| `market` | string | A market slug, e.g. `japan`, `crypto`, `us` |
| `search` | string | Matches against symbol or name |
| `limit` | int | Default `50`, max `500` |
| `offset` | int | Default `0` |
| `lang` | string | `en` (default) \| `es` \| `pt` \| `ja` \| `zh` — localizes `market_name` |

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/assets?market=crypto&search=bitcoin"
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 21,
    "symbol": "BCH",
    "name": "Bitcoin Cash",
    "asset_type": "crypto",
    "currency": "USD",
    "market": "crypto",
    "market_name": "Crypto",
    "index_name": null
  },
  {
    "id": 22,
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "asset_type": "crypto",
    "currency": "USD",
    "market": "crypto",
    "market_name": "Crypto",
    "index_name": null
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/prices`

Daily OHLCV history for one asset, in its native currency (see the asset's `currency`
field from `/api/assets`) — there's no server-computed USD field, since for USD-native
assets that'd just duplicate `close`, and for the ~1,600 non-USD assets it'd be a
redundant FX-converted copy of every row with no server-side reader. Converting to USD
or any other currency is left to the client. Resolve the asset either with `asset_id`
directly, or with both `market` and `symbol` — a ticker alone isn't unique across
markets (the same symbol can exist on more than one exchange).

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `asset_id` | int | Direct asset id *(or use `market` + `symbol`)* |
| `market` | string | A market slug — required if using `symbol` |
| `symbol` | string | A ticker (`AAPL`) or crypto id (`bitcoin`) — required if using `market` |
| `from` / `to` | date | `YYYY-MM-DD`, default full history |
| `limit` | int | Default `2000`, max `10000` |

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/prices?market=crypto&symbol=bitcoin&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-03"
```

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "open": "42280.23437500",
    "high": "44175.43750000",
    "low": "42214.97656250",
    "close": "44167.33203125",
    "volume": 18426978443
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-02",
    "open": "44187.14062500",
    "high": "45899.70703125",
    "low": "44176.94921875",
    "close": "44957.96875000",
    "volume": 39335274536
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-03",
    "open": "44961.60156250",
    "high": "45503.24218750",
    "low": "40813.53515625",
    "close": "42848.17578125",
    "volume": 46342323118
  }
]
```

A well-formed request for an asset that doesn't exist returns `404`, not an empty
`200` — that distinction is enforced at the resolver, not left to callers to infer
from an empty array.

### `GET /api/catalog`

Founders, founding date, a short history, and official links for one asset. Same
asset-resolution rule as `/api/prices` (`asset_id`, or `market` + `symbol`).

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `asset_id` | int | Direct asset id *(or use `market` + `symbol`)* |
| `market` / `symbol` | string | Same pairing rule as `/api/prices` |
| `lang` | string | `en` (default) \| `es` \| `pt` \| `ja` \| `zh` |

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/catalog?market=crypto&symbol=bitcoin"
```

```json
{
  "asset_id": 22,
  "founders": ["Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonymous, identity never confirmed)"],
  "founded": "2009-01-03 (genesis block)",
  "history": "The first decentralized cryptocurrency. Introduced in an October 2008 whitepaper as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system; the network launched with the genesis block on 2009-01-03. Uses proof-of-work mining and a fixed 21 million coin supply cap.",
  "official_website": "https://bitcoin.org",
  "logo_url": "https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/1/large/bitcoin.png",
  "info_url": "https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin",
  "issuer": null,
  "index_provider": null,
  "inception_date": null
}
```

`founded`/`history` are resolved server-side to a single string in the requested
`?lang=`, falling back to English for any asset not yet translated into that language
— translation coverage fills in incrementally, so this is never a `404`, only a
graceful fallback.

### `GET /api/fx`

Daily historical value of one currency against the US dollar — a dedicated dataset
(`fx_rates`), not part of `assets`/`daily_prices`, since exchange rates aren't
tradeable assets with a market/exchange. Currently covers `BRL`, `CNY`, `JPY`, `EUR`,
`KRW`.

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `currency` | string | Required. One of `BRL`, `CNY`, `JPY`, `EUR`, `KRW` — anything else is a `400` |
| `from` / `to` | date | `YYYY-MM-DD`, default full history |
| `limit` | int | Default `2000`, max `10000` |

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://www.cryptoally.dev/api/fx?currency=BRL&from=2024-01-01&to=2024-01-03"
```

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "open": "0.2061643084",
    "high": "0.2061090744",
    "low": "0.2060793422",
    "close": "0.2061643084"
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-02",
    "open": "0.2060835949",
    "high": "0.2062066556",
    "low": "0.2038694475",
    "close": "0.2060835949"
  },
  {
    "date": "2024-01-03",
    "open": "0.2031488010",
    "high": "0.2041210781",
    "low": "0.2027205112",
    "close": "0.2031488010"
  }
]
```

Every value is USD per 1 unit of `currency` (e.g. a `close` of `0.2061643084` for BRL
means 1 BRL was worth about $0.206 USD that day) — normalized to this direction
server-side regardless of which way the underlying source quotes it, so every
currency's data means the same thing.

## Markets covered

Query any of these via `/api/assets?market=<slug>` — slugs are lowercase, e.g. `japan`,
`south_korea`, `uae`, `crypto`.

## Architecture

- **Clean architecture, dependency-inversion layers**:
  - `domain/` — entities, newtypes (`AssetId`, `MarketSlug`, `Lang`, `ApiKeyHash`, …),
    and repository traits ("ports"). No `sqlx`, no `axum` — this layer knows nothing
    about HTTP or Postgres.
  - `application/` — thin services orchestrating the ports.
  - `infrastructure/` — the real Postgres-backed repository implementations.
  - `http/` — the axum `Router`, handlers, auth middleware, error mapping.
- **One axum `Router`, one Vercel function.** Every route is matched for real inside
  axum (not per-file bins) — this is what makes auth a single middleware `Layer`
  instead of copy-pasted per handler, and what makes the endpoints properly testable.
- **SQL injection is structurally ruled out, not just avoided.** Every query goes
  through `sqlx` with parameterized, compile-time-checked binds — no query is ever
  built by string interpolation.
- **Newtype pattern.** `AssetId(i64)`, `MarketSlug(String)`, `ApiKeyPlaintext` vs.
  `ApiKeyHash` — wrapping primitives so the type system, not convention, prevents
  mixing up e.g. a plaintext key and a stored hash.
- **Least-privilege database access.** The API's runtime credential is read-only and
  distinct from any credential used by data ingestion, which runs entirely
  out-of-band from this API. There is no write endpoint, authenticated or otherwise.
- **API-key auth**, SHA-256 hash lookup against a hashed-credential store — never
  plaintext at rest, never a JWT (no signed/stateless token here — a request is
  checked against the database on every call, which is what makes a key instantly
  revocable).
- **Tested against fakes, not a live database.** `domain::ports` traits mean the HTTP
  layer — routing, auth, status codes, JSON shape — is exercised end-to-end in tests
  through in-memory fake repositories, with zero database dependency in the test
  process.

## Usage & access

The CryptoAlly API and its data are a **commercial service**. They are not free, not open
data, and not open for public use. Every endpoint except `/api/health` requires an API key
issued to a customer, and keys are currently issued on request rather than self-service.

**Terms of use**
- A key belongs to the account it was issued to. Do not share it, and do not embed it in
  public code or in an app or page that anyone can read.
- Usage limits are set per plan and apply per key.
- No redistribution, resale, bulk copying, scraping, or building a competing dataset from
  the responses.
- Abuse leads to suspension or revocation of the key.
- If you display, publish, or build on data from this API, credit

## What's intentionally not here

This repo does not include: database schema or migrations, the data-ingestion
pipeline, any raw or processed dataset, deployment credentials/environment
configuration, or the API's homepage/UI. Those live in a separate, private repository.

## License

The source code in this repository is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). This
covers the code only. The data, the API service, and the CryptoAlly and Artificialss names
are proprietary and all rights are reserved; see [Usage & access](#usage--access) above.

## About

CryptoAlly is built by **[Artificialss](https://artificialss.ai)**. This repository is
the public engineering reference for the API; the product itself — screeners, charts,
and the rest of the CryptoAlly experience — lives at
**[cryptoally.app](https://cryptoally.app)**, with the live API and its full docs at
**[www.cryptoally.dev](https://www.cryptoally.dev)**.

Under the hood: a Postgres database (hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech), Vercel's
Marketplace-native serverless Postgres) holds every asset, market, and daily price
point, reachable only through this Rust API — no client, browser, or mobile app ever
connects to the database directly. The API itself runs on Vercel's official Rust
runtime, built around the clean-architecture layers documented above (`domain` /
`application` / `infrastructure` / `http`), with role-scoped database credentials
(`api_readonly` for every live request, a separate `seed_writer` for the offline
ingestion job) so the request path that serves you has no write access to the data at
all.
